            <h2 class="headers">Tips for learning coding</h2>
            <p class="descriptions">Here are some tips that may help you in your journey in learning to code:</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="tips">Start (mini) projects every now and then</li>
                <p class="descriptions">Starting your own projects is one of the most important parts when learning how to code. Often times people just continually watch tutorials and end up getting stuck in what is known as "tutorial hell", where they understand the code, but don't know how to apply it. Making your own projects is one of the best ways to improve your coding skills.</p>

                <li class="tips">Learn the fundamentals of the language well</li>
                <p class="descriptions">Mastering and understanding the funamentals of any language is crucial in progressing in the learning of coding. Skipping over the fundamentals can lead to difficulties in learning more advanced syntax in the language you are trying to learn. This is undeniably one of the most important things to keep in mind when learning to code.</p>

                <li class="tips">Look at other people's code</li>
                <p class="descriptions">There is nothing wrong with looking at or even copying part of people's code. It's a natural thing for all coders who are just getting started learning a language. However, it is important that you understand the code you are copying to ensure you learn and not just blindly follow. Remember to also experiment with the code you find and see what changes can be made to suit your project better.</p>

                <li class="tips">Google</li>
                <p class="descriptions">Googling is one of the most important skills for any coder to have. Every coder runs into problems they might not know how to solve. Don't be afraid to google and look for more resources online. This is where our <a href="../additionalResources/additionalResources.html" class="additional-resources-link">Additional Resources</a> come in. If you're facing a problem, go online, read documentation, and apply it.</p>

                <li class="tips">Find a friend</li>
                <p class="descriptions">Finding a friend who also codes is a great way to stay motivated to continue learning how to code. Whenever you have any questions, you can discuss with your friend. If anything, find a friend who also wants to learn how to code and hold each other accountable. Maybe in the future you guys can even make a project together...</p>
